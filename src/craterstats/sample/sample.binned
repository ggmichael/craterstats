# Craterstats: sample binned PF
# -----------------------------
#
# Counting area, in km^2

area = 123.0 


#
# Bins should be in ascending order
# Set the final bin width by adding an additional bin with 0 frequency (e.g. 0.7  0)
#
# For a normal count, provide the area and a table of diameter vs frequency.
# For buffered counts, it may be useful to provide the frequency (density) relative to a standard area (e.g. 1 km2 or 10^6 km2). In such a case,
# you should additionally provide the event_frequency, i.e. the actual number of craters counted of the given size. This is required to 
# properly calculate the stochastic error. Substitute the folowing line for the table header:
#
# table = {diameter,frequency,event_frequency
